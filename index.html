                    and
                    seasonings like chilli powder, chaat masala, ginger and garlic paste. This recipe is very easy and
                    quick to

                <h3 class="title2">Mutton Steak With Sugar</h3>
                <p id="page1">Each mutton steak or chop is made up of a sheep's loins, tenderloins, and belly flap and
                    weighs about
                    a
                    pound and a half. It's just seasoned with salt and popped into the broiler for each side to brown,
                    allowing the natural sugars in the meat to caramelize.</p>

                <h3 class="title3">Spicy Red Lentils Curry</h3>
                <p id="page2">I chose red lentils for this recipe because they break down easily and cook fast. Also,
                    red lentils
                    give
                    the curry a nice creamy texture. If you do not have red lentils, you can use brow or green lentils,
                    split yellow peas, or split mung beans.</p>
